# polycore-lipid-causal
This repository provides code, a small demo dataset, and reproducible pipelines for Poly-CORE causal machine learning that maps sweat lipids to blood lipids.

### Environment
We recommend using Conda to reproduce our results:

```bash
conda env create -f environment/environment.yml
conda activate polycore
